Git UniTEAM is a Unity Editor extension that lets you manage your Git versioned Unity project without 3rd party application requirements.

As I no longer have time to properly update this asset to work with Unity 4.0+, it is now freely available.

Features:
* Commit / Push changes from within Unity!
* Clone remote repositories.
* Integrated Diff.
* .gitignore rules.
* View real-time, uncommited changes to the repository.
* Add untracked files.
* View locally stashed commits, and commits that are behind you on your remote Git server.
* View full repository commit history complete with Diff, and commit messages.
* Access the console from 'Window > Git UniTEAM Console'

Full merge support coming soon.

* Mac OS X is not directly supported by the 'git2' plugin provided in this asset. HOWEVER you can freely build your own native application bundle from source <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2">HERE</a>, and drop it in the 'Plugins' directory of this asset.

* This asset uses native code plugins -- Pro only.
